# Remove Date from header.
# 
# The date that the client users is often in their own timezone.
# this is not desirable, so removing and having the server re-add
# the date header, enables hiding the users timezone.
#
# NOTE: postfix requires the following settings:
#  - always_add_missing_headers=yes
#  - local_header_rewrite_clients=permit_sasl_authenticated,permit_mynetworks,permit_inet_interfaces
#
# These settings will add the date back to the E-Mail header using the servers timezone.

/^Date:/        IGNORE

# Remove the sender IP Address and Any hostname and replace with localhost
